## project1: Calculator

> The goal of this project is to write a calculator program with RISC-V assembly language. This program will perform the 32-bit addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with unsigned numbers. This will use a RISC-V emulator called RARS for this project.
----------
+ requirements
  1. write a RISC-V assembly language program that perform the 32-bit addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  2. Input and result of the computation are 32-bit values.
  3. You cannot use "mul","mulh","mulhu","div","divu","rem","remu",and "sub" instruction.
  4. You have to implement the algorithms that we have studied in Chapter 3 for the multiplication and division.
  5. Your program should read a string from the console of the RARS emulator and print the computation result to the console.
